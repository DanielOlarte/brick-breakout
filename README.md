## Overview

Fun and abstract arkanoid – breakout – brick breaker! Exciting challenge with differents bonuses and power-ups. Bounce the ball and try to conquer each level. It was develop by a team of two programmers using Unity3D and free assets for sounds and graphics. Also, we used 2DToolkit for better handling of 2D sprites. We designed and implemented the main systems for handling collisions between the ball, bricks and paddle, and the powerup and score system to keep track of any changes. Also, we created a simple level builder from files, which made easy create different levels without problems.
